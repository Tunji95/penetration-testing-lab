# penetration-testing-lab

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- Vulnerable VM (Metasploitable2)

## Objectives
- Set up a virtual penetration testing lab
- Perform reconnaissance, scanning, and exploitation
- Document vulnerabilities and remediation strategies

## Steps Taken
1. Installed and configured Kali Linux in VirtualBox
2. Deployed a vulnerable VM (Metasploitable2)
3. Ran Nmap scans to identify open ports and services
4. Used Metasploit to exploit discovered vulnerabilities
5. Documented attack path and mitigations

## Sample Output
- `nmap_scan.txt` (Nmap results)
- `exploit_output.txt` (Metasploit session logs)

## Lessons Learned
- How attackers enumerate systems
- Importance of patch management
- Role of segmentation and least privilege in prevention
